# JetsonNano

- ### Without Proportional Derivate Control (100m travel).
*The vehicle travels for 100 meters.*  
*It does not go straight line due to physical erros,*
*such as friction or dusts on the floor,*  
*or slightly different shape on each wheel.*

- ### With PD Control. High spring gain K. (65m travel).  
*The vehicle revocers its track to the center using PD control*  
*With high k value, the vehicle waggles extremely at the beginning, but it finally get back to the center line successfully.*
